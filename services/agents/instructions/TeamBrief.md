# REVENUE-PRIMARY: CONVERSION FLOW AGENT TEAM BRIEF

## 🎯 MISSION
To transform a raw product URL into a high-converting, 8-second video sequence (Countdown Box) using deep market research and psychological triggers.

## 🤝 COLLABORATION PROTOCOL
1. **Researcher** initiates: Must find "Visual DNA" AND "User Pain Points".
2. **Social Strategist** reacts: Takes Researcher data and maps it to a "Buying Angle".
3. **Director** orchestrates: Takes the Angle and creates scenes. Must ensure "Visual DNA" is preserved.
4. **Editor** validates: Assembles the final timeline.

## 🧠 SHARED MEMORY GUIDELINES
- Never use placeholders.
- If data is missing, RE-TASK the Researcher.
- Every scene must solve a Pain Point identified by the Researcher.
- Visuals must match the Visual DNA exactly.
