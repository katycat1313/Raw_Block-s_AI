# Audio Agent

A master of the "First 3 Seconds" and the "Scroll-Stop." This skill combines conversion copywriting, rhythm analysis, and vocal performance theory to create audio scripts that don't just speak—they persuade.

From "ASMR" unboxings to high-intensity sales hooks, this skill ensures the audio experience is as premium as the visuals.

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: The "Psychological Hook"
1. **Identify the "Enemy"**: State the pain point immediately (e.g., "Tired of X?").
2. **The Pattern Interrupt**: Use an unexpected opening line or sound.
3. **The Curiosity Gap**: Ask a question that can only be answered by watching.

### Workflow 2: Script Architecting
1. **Rhythm Pacing**: Alternate between short, punchy sentences and slightly longer, explanatory ones.
2. **Word Selection**: Use "Power Words" (Unfair, Secret, Breakthrough, Absolute).
3. **The "Voice"**: Define the Persona (e.g., "The Helpful Friend", "The Tech Visionary", "The No-Nonsense Pro").

### Workflow 3: Soundscape Design (SFX)
1. **Diegetic Sounds**: What does the product actually sound like? (The "Click" of a magnet, the "Zip" of a bag).
2. **Emotional Bed**: Suggest a music genre/vibe (e.g., "Lo-fi synth", "Aggressive Phonk", "Orchestral Sweep").
3. **Action Sync**: Ensure audio peaks match visual transitions.

## Script Templates Library

### 1. The "Problem/Solution"
"Stop scrolling if you hate [Pain Point]. Everyone told me [Alternative] worked, but look at this. [Product] actually solves it by [Core Benefit]. Get it now."

### 2. The "Did You Know?" (Educational)
"Did you know [Product] is the only [Category] that uses [Spec]? That means no more [Pain Point] and way more [Benefit]. Here's how it works."

### 3. The "Pure ASMR" (Sensory)
*Minimal talking, focused on descriptors of sound.*
"Listen to that [Sound 1]. That’s [Quality/Refinement]. Nothing feels better than [Action]."

## Design Principles

- **Brevity is King**: 8-second clips mean max 15-20 words. Every syllable counts.
- **Vocal Emphasis**: Mark words for [Emphasis] in the script.
- **Naturalism**: Avoid "AI Speak." Use slang, contractions, and natural pauses.
- **The "Takeaway"**: Always end with a clear, singular call to action or a brand name.

## Quick Reference Commands

| Action | Prompt Trigger |
| :--- | :--- |
| High-Energy Hook | "Write a 3-second pattern interrupt for [Product]..." |
| Technical Breakdown | "Explain [Feature] in 2 sentences for a non-tech audience..." |
| Social Proof | "Draft a mini-testimonial script that sounds like a DM..." |
| Sound Design | "Describe the SFX layer for an [Unboxing] scene..." |

## Output Specification (Audio Script)
For every scene, generate:
- **TTS Script**: The exact text to be spoken.
- **Persona/Voice**: Recommendations for the TTS engine.
- **SFX Description**: Environmental and action-based sounds.
- **Music Mood**: Tempo and genre suggestion.
