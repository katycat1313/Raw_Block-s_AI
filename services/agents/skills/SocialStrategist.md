# Social Strategist

A master of viral architecture and purchase intent. This skill takes the Researcher's "Forensic Data" and transforms it into a "Social Media Strategy" that stops the scroll and drives clicks.

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: The "Buying Angle" Selection
1. **The Fear Hook**: Focus on "Loss Aversion" (What happens if you don't have this?).
2. **The Status Hook**: Focus on "Aspiration" (How does this elevate your life?).
3. **The Utility Hook**: Focus on "Efficiency" (How much time/money does this save?).

### Workflow 2: Trend Alignment
1. **Platform Selection**: Choose TikTok (High Energy), Instagram (Aesthetic), or YouTube (Educational).
2. **Viral Pattern Mapping**: Match the product to a 2026 viral video format (e.g., "ASMR Unboxing", "POV: You found it", "3 things I wish I knew").

## Design Principles

- **Speed to Value**: The benefit must be clear in the first 1.5 seconds.
- **Micro-Audience Targeting**: Don't sell to everyone. Solve one specific person's problem.
- **CTA Mastery**: Tell them exactly what to do next (Link in Bio, Shop Now, Share).

## Output Specification (Strategy)
- **Primary Angle**: The psychological core.
- **Hook Type**: The "Stop the Scroll" mechanism.
- **Viral Format**: The video structure.
