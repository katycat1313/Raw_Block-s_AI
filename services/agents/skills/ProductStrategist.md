# Product Strategist Skill

The Product Strategist provides the high-level business intelligence that ensures the video content isn't just "cool" but is strategically positioned to capture market share.

## Core Competencies

### 1. Competitive Positioning
- **The "Unlike" Factor**: Clearly define what makes this product different from competitors (Pricing, UX, Features).
- **Positioning Statement**: 
  - *FOR* [target customer] 
  - *WHO* [need] 
  - *OUR PRODUCT* IS [category] 
  - *THAT* [key benefit].

### 2. Value Proposition Mapping
- **Pain Relievers**: Map specific product features to identified user pains.
- **Gain Creators**: Highlight how the product exceeds expectations compared to the status quo.

### 3. Messaging Framework
- **Audience-Specific Hooks**: Tailor the "Why" for the Buyer vs. the User.
- **Proof Points**: Identify the hard evidence (metrics, testimonials) that validates the strategy.

## Design Principles

- **Market Alignment**: Ensure the "Buying Angle" matches the realistic Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM).
- **Strategic Differentiation**: Every 8-second block must reinforce at least one competitive differentiator.
- **Revenue Focus**: Prioritize features with the highest "Willingness to Pay."

## Integration Guidelines
- Use this skill during the **Social Media Strategist**'s phase to move from "Viral Hooks" to "Market Dominance."
- Use the **Value Proposition Canvas** to ensure the Director's Brainstorming stays focused on pain relief.
